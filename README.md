## Build Instructions

This project uses a Makefile for managing build tasks. Here are some of the commands you can use:

- `make all`: Default target, sets up the virtual environment and runs the build.
- `make help`: Shows available make targets.
- `make create_venv`: Creates a virtual environment and installs necessary modules.
- `make activate`: Activates the virtual environment.
- `make build`: Sets up the virtual environment and runs the build.
- `make upload`: Builds the project and uploads it to PyPI.
- `make clean`: Removes the virtual environment and build artifacts.

Remember to run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment before running the build commands.
